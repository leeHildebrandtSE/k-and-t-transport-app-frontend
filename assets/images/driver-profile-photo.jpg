# This is a placeholder file - In a real implementation, you would download an actual image file from Pexels
# For example, a professional driver photo like: https://images.pexels.com/photos/2379004/pexels-photo-2379004.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=400
# This would be a binary image file, but since we can't create actual image files here, this serves as a placeholder
